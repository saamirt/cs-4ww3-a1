where I went above and beyond the scope: I used the Block Element Modifier standard in writing my CSS to set a standard for highly modular, less convoluted, and easily readable CSS, while also adding faster rendering to pages by reducing the need to repeatedly redraw the page. Furthermore, I also used Adobe Illustrator to design a clean and thematically appropriate background for the site. Finally, I also used Bootstrap in order to build a more responsive website and Font-Awesome to provide stylish vector icons.
